# jsim
A small spice for study. 

## History 

This is very simple spice written by Python. 
Jack, Vencent and I joked that we should make a simulator named JSIM (Jack-Sim) when I was in Synopsys.

Jack will leave the office on 2016.9.

I deceided to make a small spice for study ( and for new employees).
